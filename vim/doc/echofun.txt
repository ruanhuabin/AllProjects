Usage: 
              When you type '(' after a function name 
              in insert mode, the function declaration 
              will be displayed in the command line 
              automatically. Then you may use Alt+- and 
              Alt+= (configurable via EchoFuncKeyPrev 
              and EchoFuncKeyNext) to cycle between 
              function declarations (if exists). 

              Another feature is to provide a balloon tip 
              when the mouse cursor hovers a function name, 
              macro name, etc. This works with when 
              +balloon_eval is compiled in. 

Options: 
              g:EchoFuncLangsDict 
                Dictionary to map the Vim file types to 
                tags languages that should be used. You do 
                not need to touch it in most cases. 
              g:EchoFuncLangsUsed 
                File types to enable echofunc, in case you 
                do not want to use EchoFunc on all file 
                types supported. Example: 
                  let g:EchoFuncLangsUsed = ["java","cpp"] 
              g:EchoFuncMaxBalloonDeclarations 
                Maximum lines to display in balloon declarations. 
              g:EchoFuncKeyNext 
                Key to echo the next function 
              g:EchoFuncKeyPrev 
                Key to echo the previous function
